## Prosody features

```sh
prosody.py
```

Compute prosody features from continuous speech based on duration, fundamental frequency and energy.

Static or dynamic features can be computed:

The static feaature vector is formed with 13 features and include

1. Average fundamental frequency in voiced segments
2. Standard deviation of fundamental frequency in Hz
3. Variablity of fundamental frequency in semitones
4. Maximum of the fundamental frequency in Hz
5. Average energy in dB
6. Standard deviation of energy in dB
7. Maximum energy
8. Voiced rate (number of voiced segments per second)
9. Average duration of voiced segments
10. Standard deviation of duratin of voiced segments
11. Pause rate (number of pauses per second)
12. Average duration of pauses
13. Standard deviation of duration of pauses


The dynamic feature matrix is formed with 13 features computed for each voiced segment and contains:

- 1 Duration of the voiced segment
- 2-7. Coefficients of 5-degree Lagrange polynomial to model F0 contour
- 8-13. Coefficients of 5-degree Lagrange polynomial to model energy contour

Dynamic prosody features are based on
Najim Dehak, "Modeling Prosodic Features With Joint Factor Analysis for Speaker Verification", 2007

### Notes:

1. The fundamental frequency is computed using Praat. To use the RAPT algorithm change the "pitch method" variable in the function phonation_vowel.

2. When Kaldi output is set to "true" two files will be generated, the ".ark" with the data in binary format and the ".scp" Kaldi script file

### Runing
Script is called as follows
```sh
python prosody.py <file_or_folder_audio> <file_features.txt> [dynamic_or_static (default static)] [plots (true or false) (default false)] [kaldi output (true or false) (default false)]
```

### Examples:
```sh
python prosody.py "./001_ddk1_PCGITA.wav" "featuresDDKst.txt" "static" "true"
python prosody.py "./001_ddk1_PCGITA.wav" "featuresDDKdyn.txt" "dynamic" "true"
python prosody.py "/home/camilo/Camilo/data/BDKayElemetrics/Norm/Rainbow/" "featuresDDKdynFolder.txt" "dynamic" "false"
python prosody.py "/home/camilo/Camilo/data/BDKayElemetrics/Norm/Rainbow/" "featuresDDKstatFolder.txt" "static" "false"
python prosody.py "/home/camilo/Camilo/data/BDKayElemetrics/Norm/Rainbow/" "featuresDDKdynFolder.txt" "dynamic" "false" "true"

```
